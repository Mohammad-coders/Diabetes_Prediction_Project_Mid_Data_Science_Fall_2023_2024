sort(table(mydata$gender),decreasing = TRUE): this part sorts the frequency in descending order.


IQR: Before getting started, let’s understand what are quartiles? Quartiles are the values that divide a list of
 numerical data into three quarters.  There are three quartiles, first, second and third, denoted by Q1, Q2 and Q3. 
Here, Q2 is nothing but the median of the given data.
The interquartile range defines the difference between the third and the first quartile. Quartiles are
 the partitioned values that divide the whole series into 4 equal parts. So, there are 3 quartiles. First Quartile is 
denoted by Q1 known as the lower quartile, the second Quartile is denoted by Q2 and the third Quartile is denoted by Q3 known 
as the upper quartile.
 Therefore, the interquartile range is equal to the upper quartile minus lower quartile.


Interquartile range = Upper Quartile – Lower Quartile = Q­3 – Q­1
